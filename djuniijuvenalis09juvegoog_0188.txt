164. Metuentqneflogeliir being under severe deseipline. '
155. fflrsdto . . . Capelld: this reading is better than the one adopt·

156. Forsitan. . . doleas :, i. e. you may perhaps think that Virro

treats you in this poor manner, to save expense ; but you are mistaken,
he does it, to vex you, and then 'to laugh at you.

157. Nam . . . maiori : i. e. there can be no comcdy more pleasing,
no buffoon more laughable, than a disappointed glotino, bemoanirrg
himself with tears of anger and resentment at such wretched fare, and
gnashing and grating his teeth together, having nothing to put between
them, tnlreep them asunder.

158. Ergo: this line is thus divided,
¹ Quis meli-lor piri-{rente gir-l l’ergo Ι omnib Ι sirint.

164. Etruscam . . . auroris: the galders bose or bulla was adopted
hy the Romans from the= Etrurians, and at first was wem only hythe

study of wisdom.

165. Vel nodus . . . loro: abolla or boos of leather, a sign or note
of freemen, worn by the poorer sort of children, and suspended at the

which you have been insulted and deserving no better friend, than

Virro who hes derides}i you.
