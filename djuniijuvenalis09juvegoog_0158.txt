olcncc oi vice, ond total disregnrd os unmoumiog virtue, is introduced
on the pointel quitting Rome lor Cumae. The Poet accompanles him
some little way from the city, when the honest exile, no longer able to
suppress his indignatum, acquaints him with the cauma ol his retire-
ment.

What he 'says may he arranged under the lollowlng herda—that Flat-
tery and Vlce are the only thriving arts at Rome; that in these, per·
ticulnrly the first, foreigners' have a manifest superiority over the na·
lives and consequently engross all favour3 that the poor are rmiveraally
exposed to' soom end inculti that the generet habits ol extravageuee
render it difficolt lor thern to subsist3 and that a crowded capital suh·
jecta them to numbcrleso inconvenienees unknown in the country: he
then again adverto to thc peculiar rufferlngs ot' the poorer citizens from
the want oi n well reguleted police ; these he illustratos hy a variety os
examples‚ and concludes in a ennio oi pathos ond heauty‚ which wlnds Ι

up theothole with singular etl'ect.
