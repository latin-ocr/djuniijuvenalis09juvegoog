NOTES.

SATIRE VI.

This is not only the longest, hut the' most complete ol our author’s
works. With respect to his other Satires, some ol them are distinguish-
ed by one excellence, and some hyanothe13 hut in this he has com-
bined them all. Forcible in argument, flowing in diction, bold, impas-
sioned, and sublime; it seems as it the poet had risen with his flrcme,
aud, conscious osits extent, taxed cll his powers to do it justice.

The whole of this Satire is ahitter invective against the female sex,
and the poet endeavours to dissuade his liiend Ursidius Postumus from

marriage, at the expense ol the whole sex. ,‚

It would seem, from internal evidence, thot this Satire was written
under Domitian. It has few political ellusions3 and might not, from its
subject, perhaps, have been displeasing to that ferocious hypocrite, who
affected, at venons times, nwondersul anxiety- to restraiu the licentious·
nese ot the age.

1. satureo: theson ol Ocelum and Terrc; under his reign in Italy
the poets place the golden age.

3. Larem: Lar significo a god, whose image was lrept within the
house and set in the chimney or on the hearth, end was supposed to
preside over sud protect the horrse and land.

5. Montana. . . ocor .· ‘the mountain wife ;’ i. e. living in densand
caves ot the mountains.

t. cynthia: mistress to the poet Propertius-Nec tihi. . . ocellos:
Lesbio, mistress to Catullus, who wrote an elegy on the death oi a
, sparrow.

9. Potcndc . . mugnis: according to Hesiod, in the Golden age,
men were accounted infante, and under the care of their mother, till
neers hundred years old. Potamia well suits this idea, for men might
rather be said to duct, than to suck.

10. &landem mutante: the first race os men were supposed to have
fed on accius. r
· 11. Ooehs: ‘the air?

12. Qui . . moti: in ancient times men were supposed to be born

of trees. The notion came from their inhahiting the trunks of large
trees.

13. Composittce luto: by Prometheus. See Class. Dict.
