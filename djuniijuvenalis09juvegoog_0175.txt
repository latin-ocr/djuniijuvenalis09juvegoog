SATIRE lv.

Juvenal, in this Satire, indulges his honest indignation against Cris·
pinus end his employer Domitian.

Alter describing some os the enormous crimes ot Crispinus, the poet ¹
meires a sudden transition to his extravagance and gluttouy, and tiaereby
tales occasion to describe a ridiculous consultation, held by Domitian
over a turbet, which was too large to be contained in any dish, that
could be found. After e long deliberation among the senators, it was
proposed, that the fish shouldbe cut in pleces and thus cooked3
but at last the opinion os the senator Montanus prevsiled, that it should
be dressed whole, audibat a dish, large enough to contain it, should be
made expressly sor the purpose oi receiving it.

'l'he council is then dismissed, and the Satine concludes with a most
severe censure on the Emperor’s cmelty end injustice towards some of
the best and most worthy os the Romans.
