given to Proserpioe, as presiding over funerals.

125. Jugulum Mycenis.- ‘ Iphigenia sacrificed at Mycene.’-lf Ag·

rich man, who, ln consequence, has made him heir to his whole estate.

126. Vei Nestora totum: ‘even to Nestor’s age!

127. Quantum . . . Nero : the rapacity of Nero was proverbial. The
sums he extorted from the provinces undervarious pretences exceed all

charge: “ Scis quid mibi opus αἲ,- et boe gamus, ne pair quidquam
babeat.” Yon know whathant3 letus manage ia such aruauuer,

SATIRE xiii.

Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidenttal per·
son3 when the restoration of this was demanded, the man, to whom it
had been entrusted, foreswore the deposit.

The indignation, expressed by Calvinus, at this breach of trust, seems
to have reached the ears of his friend J uvenal, who endeavours to soothe
and comfort him under his loss: in doing this, the poet speaks of the
villany of the ilmes, shows that nothing can hoppen, but by the wilt of
movidence, and that wicked men carry with them their own punish·
ment.

4. Gratia. . . urnam: in criudnal cases, the Praetor Urbanus, who
sat as chiefjudge‚ put into au um the names of his assessore (a kind of
jury-men, who, to the amount of some hundred, were annually ohoseu
for this purpose), from which he drew out the number prescribed by
law, usually, about fifty, who sat by hhn at the trial. When the
pleadiugs were over, they reriaed and deliberated on what hod passed.
On their retum, they had each three waxen tables put into their hands,
one of which was marked with the letter C. for condemno, guilty3 an-
other, with the lettard. for obsoleo, not guilty3 and a third, with the
letters N. L. oon liquet, I am doubtful. One of these tablets, each
person dropt privately into au um, which the Praetor took out, and pro·
nounced sentence, according to the decision of the majority.
